# CLL251

This repository contains the code for temperature measurement with Arduino. This resource was used in our experiment to calculate the temperature variations of the cpu with time and different mode of cooling mechanisms.
The device  stored the readings of the system at regular intervalsk that helped in visualizing the temperature profiles along with time.
