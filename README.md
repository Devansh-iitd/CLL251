# CLL251

This repository contains the code for temperature measurement with Arduino. This resource was used in our experiment to calculate the temperature variations of the cpu with time and different mode of cooling mechanisms.
The device  stored the readings of the system at regular intervalsk that helped in visualizing the temperature profiles along with time.

## Setup

The whole setup comprises of various components that work mutually to give the end result.
### Temperature Sensor: 
A temperature sensor (e.g., KY013) is placed inside the device of interest to measure the temperature continuously. The sensor provides real-time temperature data to the Arduino.
### Arduino Microcontroller: 
An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) is used to implement the control algorithm, read and store temperatures with time stamps.
